# hello-world

Hello world, 

I am beginning my journey to web dev and coding glory. I am a current project management professional with aspirations of working remotely on my own schedule. Eventually, I'll open my own coffee shop, roast my own beans, and be the head barista while my wife handles the baked goods. "I find your lack of faith, disturbing." I love the irony of that statement when I use it, since I have no faith.
