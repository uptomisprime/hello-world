# hello-world

Hello world, 

I am beginning my journey to web dev and coding glory. I am a current project management professional with aspirations of working remotely on my own schedule. Eventually, I'll open my own coffee shop, roast my own beans, and be the head barista while my wife handles the baked goods.
